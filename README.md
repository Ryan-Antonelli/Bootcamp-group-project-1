## Hurddles 
The dificulties about this project are as follows:
- JavaScript and now jQuery- Full stop.
  - Bringing to life our vision, and then realizing that vision needed to change so that it could live
  - Being comfortable with an MVP so that we have a foundation to improve upon in the future :grinning:
